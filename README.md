# Python Script for Scaffolding a Node.js Web API with GraphQL and OpenAPI Documentation

This Python script automates the process of scaffolding a fully structured Node.js web API, tailored to your application's data models. By reading from a JSON configuration file that defines your models, the script generates the necessary directories, files, and code for a comprehensive Node.js API.

## Key Features:

- **Automated Node.js API Structure**:  
  The script creates a well-organized directory structure with the following components:
  - **Controllers**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
  - **Services**: Encapsulates the business logic and processes data before passing it to the repository layer.
  - **Repositories**: Manages data access, typically interacting with a database or external APIs.
  - **GraphQL Integration**: Automatically sets up basic GraphQL schema and resolvers based on the models in the config.
  - **OpenAPI Documentation**: Generates Swagger-compatible OpenAPI documentation, based on the routes and models, ensuring your API is well-documented and easy to understand.

- **Model-driven Code Generation**:  
  The configuration is defined in a simple JSON file that outlines your data models, their properties, relationships, and any validation rules. The script then uses this configuration to generate API endpoints, GraphQL types, and OpenAPI documentation in a consistent manner.

- **Customizable Output**:  
  The generated API can be customized based on the configuration, allowing you to specify which fields should be included in the GraphQL schema, which routes should be exposed, and how they should be documented.

## How It Works:

1. **JSON Model Configuration**:  
   Define your models, including fields, types, validations, and relationships in a `models.json` file. This file serves as the blueprint for your API.
   
2. **Running the Script**:  
   Simply run the Python script, which will parse the JSON file, generate the necessary files, and scaffold a Node.js API with complete controllers, services, repository layers, GraphQL, and OpenAPI docs.

3. **API Ready for Development**:  
   After execution, the scaffolded Node.js API is ready for you to start developing, extending, and integrating with other parts of your system.

## Benefits:

- **Faster Development**: Significantly reduces the initial setup time for a new web API.
- **Consistency**: Ensures your API structure follows best practices and is scalable.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: The generated code is modular and easy to extend or modify as your project grows.
- **GraphQL and REST Support**: Provides both REST endpoints and GraphQL support out-of-the-box.
- **Automated Documentation**: OpenAPI documentation is automatically generated to ensure your API is self-documented, improving collaboration and ease of use for developers.

## Example Workflow:

1. Define models in a `models.json` file.
2. Run the Python script to scaffold the API.
3. Modify the generated API files as needed.
4. Start developing and implementing business logic.

This tool is perfect for developers looking to quickly bootstrap a standardized Node.js API while ensuring a clean, maintainable, and well-documented architecture.
